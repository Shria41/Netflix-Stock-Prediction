# Netflix-Stock-Prediction
Netflix is one of the biggest OTT platforms today and it encompasses a huge share of the stock market.  The primary objective of our project is to predict the Netflix stock prices at the start of the day.  The features taken include the opening and closing prices for a particular dayas well as, the highest and lowest stock price. The last column mentions volume which indicates the total number of shares traded on that day. In this paper, we list our findings from comparisons made for different models that have been implemented in various papers along with our proposed methodology.We have done a thorough comparison of the models that have been implemented in previous papers and this can be viewed in our literature survey. We plan on implementing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to try and accurately predict the stock prices and also comparing this model with others like ARIMA, KNN and Regression Classifiers.The dataset used in this project has been taken from Kaggle which is available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/netflix-stock-price-data-set-20022022
